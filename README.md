## Small app containing my CV as for 2019

Guidelines:
- Use of autolayout in code.
- Use of XCode 10.1 or Swift version 4.2
- Do not use external libraries.

The app consists in your own CV app. You can pick some ideas from the following list (not limited to this):
-	Professional summary.
-	Topics of knowledge / technical.
-	Past experience: company name, role name, date from - to, main responsibilities, achievements, company logo, etc.
-	You can host one/more json/xml file/s on gist.github.com and use it as the host of the data from your app (or any alternative).

Considerations:
-	The development should be approached as production code. 
-	Privilege quality over quantity.
-	Good engineering principles.
-	You can use your own CV or fake data alternatively.
-	Push your repo into Github and send us the link
